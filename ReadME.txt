**Optimizing Investments in NC Offshore Renewable Energy**

Each folder has is own ReadME file with a description of the code implemented.

directories:
----------------------------------
Data_OceanCurrent (Main output file: "OceanCurrentEnergyRM4.npz"):
1) Data of ocean current speed 
2) Data of CF for the ocean current technology
3) Data of annualized cost for the ocean current technology

----------------------------------
Data_Wave (Main output file: "WaveEnergy_Pelamis.npz"):
1) Data of significat wave height and period
2) Data of CF for the wave energy technology
3) Data of annualized cost for the wave energy technology

----------------------------------
Data_Wind (Main output file: "WindEnergyNREL.npz"):
1) Data of wind speed
2) Data of CF for the wind energy technology

A version of the code provided here is also available on Google Drive with the full set of
data used in the simulations (some of which are more than 2GB in size).
